# GA-community-detection

This project focuses on using a genetic algorithm for community detection in networks. Initially, each node is assumed to represent a separate community. The genetic algorithm is then employed to iteratively refine this initial configuration, aiming to achieve a more accurate and meaningful distribution of communities. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated by comparing the detected communities against ground truth communities.
